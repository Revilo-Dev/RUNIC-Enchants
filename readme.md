The Runic Mod 
=
Mod Developed by Revilo.Dev and KeySword Crew

Runic is a progression-focused overhaul designed to make combat, upgrading, and exploration feel more meaningful. Instead of stacking one “best” enchant across everything, players now build gear intentionally over time. Enhancements exist on runes, found through exploration, boss fights, and structure loot. Etchings offer weaker, craftable upgrades for early progress, while powerful end-game runes are earned. Workstations, armor trims, and combat mechanics have been redesigned to support long-term item progression where every upgrade matters.


# Below are the core systems and how they work: 



Some content listed below is currently not up to date, these are work in progress features yet to make it into the public version of the mod

Enhancement Slots:
Gear pieces contain enhancement slots. Runes and Etchings are applied into these slots. Stronger gear tends to have more slots.

Runes:
Runes replace enchanted books. Each rune holds a single enhancement and can stack in your inventory. Runes come in rarity tiers and are found in structures and on mobs. Rarity increases with difficulty, encouraging exploration rather than farming.

Etchings:
Etchings are weaker, craftable versions of runes. They allow players to upgrade early and mid-game gear safely. Many effects exist in two levels: Etching versions for early progression and full Rune versions for late game.

Etching Table:
Etchings are created here using blank etchings and materials. This table also produces inscriptions tied to gear progression. It provides affordable upgrades without trivializing the system.

Artisan Workbench:
This workstation applies runes and etchings onto gear. Players preview the final stats before committing upgrades, reducing mistakes and making upgrading deliberate rather than random.

Stat Enhancements:
Stat enhancements roll a random % buff on a gear piece. Their values can be rerolled using specific items, allowing players to refine a build without infinite power creep.

Effect Enhancements:
Effect enhancements work like vanilla enchants, but now only have 2 levels per enchant, level one obtained from etchings and level 2 from runes

Loot Progression:
Naturally generated gear often spawns fully enhanced but sealed. Stronger dungeons reward stronger upgrades. Progressing your character now means exploring the world, not AFK farming.

Inscriptions:
They allow repairing, slot expansion, removing enhancements, rerolling values, and increasing stats — always with trade-offs. These create real decision-making instead of automatic upgrades.

Special Inscriptions:
Cursed, Wild, and Extraction runes introduce high-risk mechanics. They can push gear beyond normal limits or permanently alter it. Powerful items now come with history and consequences.

Gear Attributes:
Items gain attributes such as Sealed, Cursed, Instable, or Negative. These do not occupy enhancement slots. Instead, they stack and permanently shape the attributes of the item.

Compatibility:
Runic is built with modded environments in mind. Most mod armor and enchant systems integrate cleanly

JEI Support:
Every enhancement can be viewed, searched, and understood directly in JEI, including where it comes from and what it does.

What Runic Aims For:
A progression system where upgrades are earned, builds matter, and every item feels personal — not something basic and unearned.
